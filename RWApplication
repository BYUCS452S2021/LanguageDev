Hello! My name is Reagan Weston, and I would love to join this project. I love the idea of a dictionary-esque app geared toward helping users create their own language. I'm a writer, and trying to come up with a fantasy language myself is a nightmare. This is an app I would love to use, and I think it would be useful for a lot of people.

I have taken a DIGHT class geared toward SQL, so I have some experience with databases, but that was several years ago so I have some relearning to do in that aspect. I am an editing minor and have taken a linguistics class. I'm by no means an expert in linguistics, but I am familiar with the field on a basic level. I have also taken some design classes, so I can help with making the UI interesting and clean to optimize user experience.

I agree with your business suggestion. I think a free version will help draw potential users in, and if the app is actually helpful then they can buy the full version. Possibly this could allow them to store more words in the language, or have more guidance from the app so they can then take their language to completion. Perhaps we could have a minimum price for the full version, with then the option to pay more. I like the idea of having additional (but not necessary) features for an additional lower price, such as the thesaurus or multiple dialects feature.

As for technical specifications, I have used Java to develop an Android application, so I do have experience in that field, but I am open to other languages and platforms.

Perhaps we could add a social aspect to the app itself, such as the ability to share langauges or words in the language with other friends who have the app, to encourage people to share their positive experiences with the app with others?

Again, I love the idea of this app, and I would be excited to join this project. Feel free to reach out to me on Slack, or email me at raygunrocks@gmail.com. Thank you!
